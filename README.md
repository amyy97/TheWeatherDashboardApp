# The Weather Dashboard
The reason I'm writing this application is to discover the best practices I could follow in writing a front-end webapp given Vue's centric 'reactive-viewmodel' approach and how my approach relates to the original 'GUI-Architecture' MVC pattern.

Another reason is that I'd like to formulate the best build setup I'd use given that vue-loader is a webpack plugin (thus using webpack and a build process is a must).

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Pending Features
- Precipitation (shown values are dummies)
- Change settings
- Support multiple screens (This should be a matter of adding a couple of css media queries)
- Set city based on current location
- Connection problems (api retrieval) feedback
